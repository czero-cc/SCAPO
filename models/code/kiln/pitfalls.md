# Kiln - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Kiln and hunting cabin reduce each other's cultivation area; bug with forest density; no ETA on fix.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Kilns overlapping and not working, clipped orchards, etc due to forest density bug.

## Cost & Limits

### üí∞ I can't figure out how to get out of "SIMULATION MODE" in this [GitHub - jbruce12000/kiln-controller: Turns a Raspberry Pi into an inexpensive, web-enabled kiln controller.](https://github.com/jbruce12000/kiln-controller)  I have tried every which way. I know I'm probably skipping a step, or misunderstanding a step. Everything has been wired correctly and tested. Has anyone but stuck at this step too? u/jbruce12000 I need help....
