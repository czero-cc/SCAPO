## Technical Tips

- To create a custom avatar with HeyGen, first record about 30 minutes of clean, high‑quality audio and use ElevenLabs’ Professional Voice Clone to train a custom voice model.
- After the avatar is generated, start a new video project in HeyGen and connect the custom voice model from ElevenLabs to the avatar.

## Usage Tips

- Upload a clear, 2‑minute video of yourself to HeyGen’s avatar creation page.
- On HeyGen, click the "Create New Avatar" button, select the "Hyper‑Realistic" option, and upload the 2‑minute video to generate the avatar.
