# Runway - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è stuck generating only one video at a time, with incredibly slow rendering times

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Probably the most frustrating career bug for me right now is the landing scores. So often when I touch down it says that I landed off runway (I didn't) or that I entered the taxiway without announcing (still in the middle of the runway). When the second glitch happens it will immediately give me at least one taxiway speeding violation as well. Most of the time this will take my rating from an S down to a B, making it very difficult to keep my reputation up. I would say one of these bugs happens

## Policy & Account Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Runway Unlimited accounts ($95/month) experience prominent throttling
**Note**: Be aware of terms of service regarding account creation.

## Cost & Limits

### üí∞ Over the past few days, using my trained model (character) it doesn't seem to matter what style I select, I'll get photographic/realistic results. I'm trying to get cartoon and graphic novel results but it keeps spitting out realistic results (and most of the time it looks nothing like my trained model. What the hell am I paying for if it's garbage results 90% of the time? Was working fine for me a few days ago, now everything is trash (right after I dropped $30 on credits, no less). What gives

### üí∞ lol see the limit is 3

### üí∞ $95/month Unlimited plan
