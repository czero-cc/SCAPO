# Astria - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ todays patch bugged out all equipment in the game. the one i had on me or in inventory and the new one i get from chests. if i go into item menu i see the stats (like +120 str, +21 mag) but when equipped no stats are added to the character. so basically u play without armour, weapon, helmet or shield.

### ⚠️ So I'm getting a TypeError when I select the Astria ckpt file for text2img in my Stable Diffusion setup... I don't see any guides on using these model files, particularly for the Astria trained files. Am I missing something obvious here?
