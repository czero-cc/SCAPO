# Playform - Common Pitfalls & Issues

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ I was just able to play half an hour ago but it lagged out and crashed. Now when I boot up the game it kicks me out for a different reason. Connection timeout, profile signed out, etc. Internet is completely fine otherwise, although sometimes I lose connection for a few moments when trying boot but not always. It’s always stuck on the "Signing into online playform" message before it forces me out.
