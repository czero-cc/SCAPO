*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Anyone receive this message before - Enhancement failed. An unknown error occurred. No further information is available.

  
This is on Remini web not the smart phone app. Was working perfectly before, but now comes up with that message every time I try to upload a pic. Video upload works fine and also can upload pics when not logged into my account so it's as if it's an account issue?

## Cost & Limits

### üí∞ the fact that it's free (with a limited number of photos per day) seems suspicious to me.
