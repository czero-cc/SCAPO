# Leonardo AI - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è A little help? Been trying to upgrade my Leo sub from Apprentice to Artisan, but get this error message: "Error: updatePlanSubscription (quote request): update-plan-subscription stripe and db price id are not matched" Any ideas?? Thx.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Leonardo AI API with Griptape crashes Comfy, no error message, just goes to press any key to continue.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Hello. I'm a newbie with Leonardo AI. After inputting my prompt, Leonardo AI threw a "no mutations exist" error message and didn't generate anything. What does that mean and how to go around this issue, please. Thanks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è I keep getting this error message about a Boolean in Cavas Editor/Image Editor. It happens regardless of the image so I guess it has to do with the settings. I hit the ‚Äúdefault reset‚Äù on the Settings and it didn‚Äôt fix itself. To be clear, I never mess with Settings other than switching to different Models. Anyway, yeah, how do I fix this? I use this service a lot and as recently as yesterday, and I‚Äôve never had this error message before. Any ideas what this is about?

## Cost & Limits

### üí∞ I've been using the Motion tool everyday for content creation and I'm on the paid plan and today all of a sudden it's been removed and replaced with a "Video" tool that costs 250 credits instead of 25 and that is not even able to do the style I ask it? Is Motion going to come back or? What's happening?
