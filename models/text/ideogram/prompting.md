*Last updated: 2025-08-14*

## Tips & Techniques

- Basically, go into dev mods, use the destroy tool to destroy any object directly related to your ideolegion (shrines, ideogram, etc...), randomize symbols, regenerate all buildings and everything should be good again.
- Prompt easily and keep the identity consistent.
- Developers worldwide can build on Ideogramâ€™s powerful character consistency capabilities now.
- Remix your style to place your character without masking.
- Edit images to place your character in a specific region.
- No more costly LoRA training is needed.
- This basically means that once you've run out of priority credits, you can generate 72 batches of images per day....theoretically.
