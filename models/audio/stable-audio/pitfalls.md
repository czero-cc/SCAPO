# Stable Audio - Common Pitfalls & Issues

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ I'm not sure if this is an intentional thing or a bug, but when I try to disable stable audio, it just doesn't do anything? I'll click it, it will take me out of the video settings, but will keep stable audio on. Has anyone else encountered this, and if so, is there a surefire way of fixing it, or is it meant to not be turned off for safety reasons or something?
