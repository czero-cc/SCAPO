*Last updated: 2025-08-12*

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ Unable to switch back to a Custom LLM after testing with built-in model gemini-2.0-flash; interface shows 'Fix the errors to proceed' even though Server URL, Model ID, and API Key are correctly filled.
**Fix**: Store API keys in environment variables or use a secrets manager.

**Note**: Be aware of terms of service regarding account creation.

## Cost & Limits

### 💰 Credits from ElevenLabs free plan do not roll over to the next month.

### 💰 $29/month for Reader unlimited plan
