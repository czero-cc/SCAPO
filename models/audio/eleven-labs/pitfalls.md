# Eleven Labs - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-14*

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ Unable to switch back to a Custom LLM after testing with a built-in model (gemini-2.0-flash); interface shows 'Fix the errors to proceed' even though Server URL, Model ID, and API Key are correctly filled.
**Fix**: Store API keys in environment variables or use a secrets manager.

### ⚠️ audio plays back a female voice regardless of which option is selected when using elevenLabs API

## Policy & Account Issues

### ⚠️ Account credits wiped (about 400,000 credits) after attempting to renew a $99/month subscription; paywall prevented payment and support ticket received no response.
**Note**: Be aware of terms of service regarding account creation.
