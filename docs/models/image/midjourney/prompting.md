## Tips & Techniques

- Use the midjourney-python-api, an open-source Python client built for the unofficial MidJourney API, leveraging a Discord self bot and the Merubokkusu/Discord-S.C.U.M library. Key features include info retrieval, imagine prompt, image upscale and vectorization by lab.
- switch to fast mode
- upgrade your plan
- You can build a simple interface on Wix that uses open-source GitHub APIs to connect to Midjourney, sending image and text prompts and storing output images in a gallery after receiving their links. It required about 70 lines of code.
