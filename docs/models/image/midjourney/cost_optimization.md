*Last updated: 2025-08-15*

## Cost & Pricing Information

- 200 image limit
- I use Midjourney quite a bit for graphic design (mainly to generate assets for thumbnails to save trawling through hundreds of pages of stock images). But the tier I use is £30 a month.
- $10 version
- The company’s image AI service, accessible through Discord, stands out with a diverse range of packages priced between $10 and $120 per month.
- $4 additional rollover GPU time
