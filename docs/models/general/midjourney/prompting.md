# Midjourney Prompting Guide

*Last updated: 2025-08-14*

## Tips & Techniques

- Use API v2 for unlimited requests
- Be mindful that using unofficial APIs like the midjourney-python-api may have risks, so use them at your own discretion.
- Leverage the midjourney-python-api, an open-source Python client for the unofficial MidJourney API, which provides features like image retrieval, prompt generation, upscaling, and vectorization.
- TLDR: MJ is the best for artistic generations compared to other models, but is artificially limiting its use-cases by not offering an API to artists who want to create dynamic, interactive, artworks. I suggest a personal API tier to allow artists to use MJ in this way.
- Midjourney is planning to launch a web interface and expand into video and 3D asset generation
- Are there any reliable alternatives I can use for outpainting?
- Midjourney's image AI service is accessible through Discord, with packages priced between $10 and $120 per month
- Set temperature=0.7 for better results
- Use version 2.3.1 to avoid crashes
