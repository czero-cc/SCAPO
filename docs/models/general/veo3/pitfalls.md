# VEO3 - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-14*

## Technical Issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è As the title suggests - what‚Äôs the point of the scene builder when you create an initial shot in VEO3 and it automatically reverts to VEO2 for the next shot? Is this a bug and is it something Google is aware of and are looking at fixing? I‚Äôm guessing the only way to create full scenes right now is to create separate projects then stitch them together in the scene builder?

## Cost & Limits

### üí∞ My experience is that VEO3 FAST will often not be able to produce a video.. not sure if this is because of traffic limits... but I used the heck out of it for 2 days while it was working all the time for me.. Now I mostly get an 'unable to creat the video' when I try to use Veo3 Fast now...

### üí∞ Has anyone else noticed these black dots all over their videos? I've wasted 100s of credits trying to get a perfect video with none of them on and, in some instances, had to edit in post which was so time consuming.
