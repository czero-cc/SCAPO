# AI Voice Agents - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ Traditional phone systems crash when multiple customers call simultaneously. Lines get busy, calls get dropped, and frustrated customers hang up before reaching anyone.

### ⚠️ Facing max token limit error from GROQ (the LLM used in the LIVEKIT SDK setup). Tried to implement minimizing context while sending to LLM and also simplified the system message, but it still fails. Need to understand how the context is populated within passing to LLM in the Voice pipeline in Livekit.
