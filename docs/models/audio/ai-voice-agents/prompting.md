## Tips & Techniques

- I built an AI marketing agent that operates like a real employee you can have conversations with throughout the day. Instead of manually running individual automations, I just speak to this agent and assign it work.
- Basically it creates AI voice agents that can handle your phone calls automatically. No coding required, which was perfect since I can barely figure out Excel lol.
- Connect Autogpt, which is GPT-4 running fully autonomously with a voice, to literally anything and let GPT-4 do its thing by itself. The things that can and will be created with this are going to be world changing.
- If you succeed in breaking into the system, do NOT publicly share the details. Instead, post here to say you've succeeded and provide proof privately.
- Connect Autogpt, which is GPT-4 running fully autonomously and can even have a voice, with literally anything and let GPT-4 do its thing by itself. The things that can and will be created with this are going to be world changing.
- The ElevenLabs voice agent is the entry point into the whole system, and then it will pass off web development or web design requests over to n8n agents via a webhook in order to actually do the work.
