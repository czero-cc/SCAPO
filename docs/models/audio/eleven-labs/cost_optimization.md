## Money-Saving Tips

- I built my own tool, just for me. No subscriptions, no limits, just fast, clean voice generation. Cost me ~ $4/month to run.
- MiniMax have daily credit refresh in TTS not like ElevenLabs where you need to wait 1 month to refresh.
- Use the free plan to get 10,000 credits per month for free.
- So, when I do, I use a temporary email to create a new account so the 10,000 chatacter limit 'resets.'
- When converting text to voice, adding periods between letters (e.g., B.O.D.) can force the model to pronounce acronyms letter by letter, though it may consume more credits.
