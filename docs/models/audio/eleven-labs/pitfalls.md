# Eleven Labs - Common Pitfalls & Issues

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ Cannot switch back to a Custom LLM after testing with a built-in model (gemini-2.0-flash) on the ElevenLabs Conversational AI dashboard; even after correctly filling out Server URL, Model ID, and API Key, the interface still shows the message: 'Fix the errors to proceed' even though there is no error.
**Fix**: Store API keys in environment variables or use a secrets manager.

### ⚠️ ElevenLabs API always returns a female voice regardless of the selected gender option

### ⚠️ Tasker Action Error: 'HTTP Request' (step 11) Task: 'Text To Speech To File Elevenlabs {"detail":{"status":"invalid_uid","message". "An invalid ID has been received: %voice_id'. Make sure to provide a correct one."}

## Policy & Account Issues

### ⚠️ Eleven Labs wiped 400,000 credits from a user's account on the $99/month plan; the user had 60% of credits left (about 400,000 credits) and was unable to renew subscription due to paywall issues.
**Note**: Be aware of terms of service regarding account creation.

### ⚠️ Free trial for ElevenLabs is limited to 10,000 characters a month, which is insufficient for scripts that are often ~20-40,000 characters long.
