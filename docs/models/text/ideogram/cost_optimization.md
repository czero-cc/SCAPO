## Cost & Pricing Information

- Generating 4 images therefore costs $0.04.
- Per API, V2 costs $0.08 per image.
- Only 5 AI credits per use
- So one credit costs $0.02.
- If you book the smallest monthly package on the website, 400 credits cost $8.
- This basically means that once you've run out of priority credits, you can generate 72 batches of images per day....theoretically. But only if you stay up all day and night. Which, if 3-credit generations is used every time, translates to 216 credits per day.

## Money-Saving Tips

- No more costly LoRA training is needed.
