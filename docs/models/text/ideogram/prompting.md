*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Tips & Techniques

- Just add `<<repl:ideogram>>` at the end of your prompt, and let the magic happen!
- The composition should be minimal, but unique and striking.
- Ideogram is best for creating logos, icons, and flyers
- Given an input prompt to a text-to-image model, rewrite the prompt into a description of a unique, stunning, captivating and creative image. Before creating the output prompt, first consider the style, and composition before describing the elements that make up the extraordinary image.
- Eli5: Using ChatGPT as a Flux Prompt Enhancer (similar to Ideogram's 'Magic Prompt').
- Ideogram’s new Character tool brings personality to AI images. You can create consistent visual traits for people or mascots across prompts, ideal for comics, branding, or storytelling. It’s a big step toward persistent identity in generative art.
- Mention all text to be generated explicitly and wrap in double quotes. Do not use double quotes for any other purpose.
- Basically, go into dev mods, use the destroy tool to destroy any object directly related to your ideolegion (shrines, ideogram, etc...), randomize symbols, regenerate all buildings and everything should be good again.
- Remix your style to place your character without masking.
- Edit images to place your character in a specific region.
- Prompt easily and keep the identity consistent.
- No more costly LoRA training is needed.
