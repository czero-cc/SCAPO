# Character.AI Prompting Guide

*Last updated: 2025-08-16*

## Tips & Techniques

- Use the Pinned Memories feature to save and pin key messages in each chat to help your Character remember important information.
- Compared to other sites where the X button is hard to find or is easily mashed in with stuff that will take you to the advertisers site, character ai's ads have clear X buttons and they are placed in a way that fat fingering them or missing by a few inches wont send you to google play store or some random site.
- Janitor AI is a free NSFW version of Character AI
- Bots do not learn from your chats, so you cannot train them by chatting.
- You also use prompts to jailbreak the Character AI and access the NSFW version
- Character.AI offers free and unlimited messaging for all users.
- Model selection is only available to character.ai+ members; if you lose your membership you cannot select models.
- Use a Bluetooth keyboard on your phone to avoid the major keyboard closing bug on mobile.
- Go to your "Style" tab on a character and scroll down to experimental. Hit "Goro", and your chats should be fixed.
