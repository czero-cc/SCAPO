## Technical Issues

### ⚠️ Trying to generate AI video to go along with my music, but I get the same error every time. Image is upscaled, passed to VAE encode into a KSampler where the error occurs. Error occurred when executing KSampler: cannot access local variable 'cond_item' where it is not associated with a value.
