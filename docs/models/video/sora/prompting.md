## Tips & Techniques

- You can generate up to 10 video clips for free; after that each video costs 100 Microsoft Rewards points
- Output specs: 1080p max, MP4 only, silent by default
- Generate 2x20 second videos at 720P for higher resolution base generations
- Use unlimited generations available for all paid tiers (plus, team, pro users)
- Use relaxed mode for faster waiting times (as experienced in Australia)
- Generate 4x20 second videos at 480P for maximum variations and then upscale the ones you like
- Queue up to three video generations at a time to keep the process efficient
- Be aware that Sora video clips are currently limited to 5 seconds and 9:16 aspect ratio, suitable for TikTok and Instagram
- 20s length cap (and why it's enforced)
- Use the Bing mobile app to access Soraâ€™s free video generation feature
- If you need more than 3 image generations per day, consider upgrading to the PLUS plan
- There is an 8k dongle released recently to enable the 8k polling rate.
- or sora if you are in the eu, it is available on altstore pal.
- Resolution workarounds: upscale v
- Install the Betterjoy controller drivers for your PC via: https://github.com/Davidobot/BetterJoy
- I log into Sora, queue up the clips I need, then use the Chrome extension Video DownloadHelper to snag the MP4s. This gives me a bottomless library of short AI videos I can drop into product demos and social ads.
