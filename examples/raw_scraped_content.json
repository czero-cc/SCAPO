    "content": "Hey guys, been struggling with GPT-4 being way too wordy. After lots of trial and error, here's what actually works:\n\n1. Start your prompt with \"Be concise.\" or \"Answer briefly.\"\n2. Use this system prompt: \"You are a helpful assistant that provides direct, concise answers without unnecessary elaboration.\"\n3. Add \"Limit your response to X sentences\" when you need specific brevity\n4. Temperature around 0.3-0.5 seems to help too\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up! Some people asked about parameters. I'm using:\n- temperature: 0.3\n- top_p: 0.9\n- frequency_penalty: 0.2\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!",
